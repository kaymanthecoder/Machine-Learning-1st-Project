# Machine-Learning-1st-Project

This is an iris dataset in pattern recognition using Scikit Learn using Python Machine Learning. The goal is to predict the class of the iris plant. Hence, it is said to be supervised learning. 

A dictionary is created to reference colors for the 3 classes. The reason why 0, 1 and 2 are used is that they represent the 3 classes, namely; Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica. Next, an array of colors is created so that the 3 classes are plotted in different colors.

The scatterplots are plotted in their respective axes and shown. My task was to mordify the subplots to make them look like the graphs in the 1st picture.
